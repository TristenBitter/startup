   Notes:
        Monday, Feb 5th, 2024 "HTML" I was able to implement the header of each of the files and link them together. 
        I created boxes, tables, and buttons that I will later implement in the continuing stages of development. 
        I set up the skeleton for the gameplay The previous assignments we did were super helpful. I found myself using those as a reference to help make the skeleton of this program. 
        I had a hard time finding an image that would actually work. When I used a stock photo it seemed to work. 
        While doing this project I have learned a lot more about the basic structure of how HTML works. I'm excited to learn how to implement CSS and JavaScript.
        To implement web Sockets I will be updating the score in real time. 
        Data will be stored in the score page as well
        I will use a web service to implement the roll dice part of play
### CSS Startup Notes
        Thursday Feb 15th, 2024   "CSS" 
                I was able to incorporate some classes into my html and apply them in css. Through that process, I learned that it is important to use the correct declarations of classes within a <div> or an <a> or some other thing. I was able to use FLEX to each part of the page to get it to re-align depending on the size. I learned to align my Title in the center and how to get my page to have a named title when you hover over the web Page. I learned to change the color of text and the backgroud to what ever I found appealing. It was difficult at first but I was able to align the navigation to the left size and space it from the name of the page.
